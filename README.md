# Super Smash Bros Command Line

Note: this project is in early stages, will remove this line once it is completed and include instructions to download.

This project stems from an initial lab I did while studying at CodeClan to practice using classes, interfaces and inheritance in Java.

Original lab and brief: https://github.com/jenmerritt/java_fantasy_adventure_game

The adaptation I've made here is to change from a Pokemon based game to a Super Smash Bros based game where the user can interact in the Command Line.
